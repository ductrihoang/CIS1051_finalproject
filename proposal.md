# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Weather app

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that retrieves and displays real-time weather information for any city entered by the user, using data from a weather API.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This is a Python weather web application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for any city they type in. The app connects to an external weather API to get real-time data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general conditions. It then display the results nicely to the user. The website is developed using the Django framework and API integration.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable. This project is completed solely for CIS 1051.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Not applicable. I work individually.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The app will successfully retrieves and displays current weather data for a user-specified city.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The app will provides additional information such as forecasts and sunrise/sunset times in addition to current weather conditions. Maybe users will be able to search for two cities at the same time.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The app will include all the features from the "better" outcome but with a nicer user interface (dynamic icons, backgrounds reflecting current conditions, etc.).

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next step will be to learn more about the Django framework. I plan to complete the "good" outcome version of the app within the next two weeks, then gradually enhance the functionality and user experience. Once I establish the basic functionality and ensure that the API data is displayed correctly, I will focus on improving the layout and styling the web interface.
